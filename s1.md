## Task Steps

### Step 1: Environment Preparation (15 minutes)

#### 1.1 Verify Shopify CLI Installation

```bash
# Check if Shopify CLI is installed
shopify version

# Expected output: Should show the current version (e.g., 3.x.x)
```

#### 1.2 Login to Shopify CLI

```bash
# Login to your Partner account
shopify auth login

# Follow the prompts to authenticate with your Partner account
# This will open a browser window for authentication
```

#### 1.3 Create Project Directory

```bash
# Navigate to where you want to create your app
cd /path/to/your/development/workspace

# Create a new directory for your project (optional)
mkdir shopify-app-tutorial
cd shopify-app-tutorial
```

### Step 2: Create the Shopify App (20 minutes)

#### 2.1 Initialize the App

```bash
# Create a new Shopify app
shopify app init

# When prompted:
# - Enter app name: "My First Shopify App" (or your preferred name)
# - Select template: Choose "Build a Remix app"
# - Wait for the initialization to complete
```

#### 2.2 Verify App Structure

After initialization, verify that the following directory structure was created:

```
my-first-shopify-app/
├── app/
├── extensions/
├── package.json
├── shopify.app.toml
├── .env
└── README.md
```

#### 2.3 Navigate to App Directory

```bash
# Navigate to your newly created app directory
cd my-first-shopify-app

# Verify you're in the correct directory
ls -la
```

### Step 3: Start Development Server (30 minutes)

#### 3.1 Start the Development Server

```bash
# Start the local development server
shopify app dev

# This command will:
# - Guide you through Partner account login
# - Create an app in the Partner Dashboard
# - Connect your local code to the app
# - Create a Prisma SQLite database
# - Create a tunnel between your local machine and development store
```

#### 3.2 Follow the Setup Process

During the `shopify app dev` process, you'll need to:

1. **Select Partner Organization**: Choose your Partner organization
2. **Select Development Store**: Choose the pre-created development store from the list
3. **Wait for Setup**: Allow the CLI to complete the setup process
4. **Note the URLs**: Pay attention to the URLs provided in the terminal

#### 3.3 Verify Server is Running

Look for output similar to:

```
✅ Your app is running at: https://your-app-url.com
✅ Your app is available at: https://your-dev-store.myshopify.com/admin/apps/your-app-name
```

### Step 4: Install App on Development Store (15 minutes)

#### 4.1 Open App Preview

- With the development server running, press `p` in the terminal
- This will open your app's preview URL in a browser

#### 4.2 Install the App

1. You'll be prompted to install the app on your development store
2. Click **"Install app"** to proceed
3. Grant the requested permissions when prompted
4. Wait for the installation to complete

#### 4.3 Verify Installation

- You should be redirected to your app's home page
- The app should be visible in your development store's admin panel
- Check that the app appears in **Apps > App and sales channel settings**

### Step 5: Test App Functionality (20 minutes)

#### 5.1 Generate a Test Product

1. From your app's home page, click **"Generate a product"**
2. This will create a sample product in your development store
3. Verify the product was created by checking your store's admin panel

#### 5.2 Explore the App Interface

- Navigate through the app's different pages
- Test any interactive elements
- Verify that the app loads properly in the Shopify admin

#### 5.3 Check Development Store

- Go to your development store's admin panel
- Navigate to **Products** to see the generated product
- Verify the product has proper details (title, description, price, etc.)

### Step 6: Verification and Documentation (20 minutes)

#### 6.1 Create Screenshots

Take screenshots of:

- [ ] Your app running in the Shopify admin
- [ ] The generated product in your development store
